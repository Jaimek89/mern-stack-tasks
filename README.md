# MERN-Stack-Tasks

## About What

>Tipical App with CRUD tasks, you can create a task, update it and delete it.
Looking to improve my React.js skills, all the App has been done with it. At this time I wanted to learn how webpack works,
so I did not use create-react-app, this App has been created from scratch. I also used Materialized to see the difference with
the popular Bootstrap 4.
